          "content": ". Hi! I am Hai Nguyen. . I came from Bac Ninh in Vietnam. In 2014, I graduated from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) majoring in Electronics and Telecommunications. I had spent 5 years working in several industrial fields (Embedded System Software, Factory Automation, Database) in both Vietnam and Japan. In 2019, I decided to pursue my graduate study at Ritsumeikan University. In 2021, I got my Master&#39;s Degree from Ritsumeikan majoring in Advance Information and Science Engineering. . Currently, I am working as a python developer in the Research Department of (ICS Partners), which is located in Kyoto Research Park (KRP). My role is to apply machine learning &amp; NLP algorithms to develop Computer Vision Web APIs for building Robotic Process Automation (RPA) products. . My research interests cover the following topics Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Data Science and OpenCV-OCR. . In my spare time, I enjoy playing badminton, gardening, hiking, camping, and studying new languages. Aside from my mother tongue (Vietnamese), I use Japanese for daily working communications and use my broken English to talk to my wife at home. In the future, I wish to learn German &amp; Chinese out of my own interests. Besides, some Tagalog should also come in handy to communicate with my wife&#39;s family. . Feel free to follow me on GitHub or connect with me on LinkedIn. . This website (powered by fastpages) is the memo of my own self-practices notebooks from Data Science related online courses or books. So it may contain some obsolete contents due to the latest updated time of the notebooks. If you find something, or have a question about the contents, just feel free to contact me through mail or comment it in each page (comments are linked to my github with utteranc.es) .",
